# git-lang-cards

![](https://travis-ci.org/sidmishraw/gitlangcards.svg?branch=master)

This is a React.js component for providing a carousel of cards. The cards show the languages the consumer likes to dabble in on GitHub. There is a link in the cards to go the consumer's GitHub projects filtered for the particular language.

By using Materialize CSS the component gains touch compatibility :D

### Motivation:

I made this component for my personal website. Decided to make it available for everyone to use and enjoy :)

### Demo:

Following is the demo GIF of the component:

### Usage:

* Include the dependencies as script tags in the HTML file:

Inside `<head>`:

```HTML
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js" integrity="sha256-hwg4gsxgFZhOsEEamdOYGBf13FyQuiTwlAQgxVSNgt4="
    crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/materialize/0.100.2/js/materialize.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/16.0.0/umd/react.production.min.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react-dom/16.0.0/umd/react-dom.production.min.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

Inside `<body>`:

```HTML
<div class="container">
  <div id="root"></div>
</div>
```

> Note: The library is exported as `gitlangcards` following the UMD convention â€” it can be consumed by all module systems in their native forms. For eg in CommonJS, consume as `require("gitlangcards")`.


* Library name: `gitlangcards`

* In JS script:

```javascript
// `gitlangcards` is the library, since I've added the bundle as a script, I can consume the library freely
// as a global variable
// The `render()` of the `GitHubLanguageColors` object takes 3 parameters:
// 1. The GitHub user name
// 2. The elementId of the div the carousel needs to be rendered inside
// 3. The callback function that needs to be called after the carousel(component) 
//    has been rendered on the screen
new gitlangcards.GitHubLanguageColors().renderOnScreen("sidmishraw", "root", () => console.log("Done"));
```

> Note: I'd recommend add the bundled js after the body elements have rendered for faster processing.

```HTML
<!-- towards the end of the <body> tag -->
<script type="text/javascript" src=".././bin/materialize.bundle.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src=".././bin/gitlangcards.bundle.js"></script>
```

> Note: load the `materialize.bundle.js` before the `gitlangcards.bundle.js` since it satisfies the CSS and JS dependencies in `gitlangcards.bundle.js`. I believe this holds only in `root` or HTML script include method for JS files. CommonJS, CommonJS2, and AMD module systems follow their conventions.
